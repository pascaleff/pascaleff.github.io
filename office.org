#+TITLE: My Office

- My office is *Room 306* at [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/805+W+Pennsylvania+Ave,+Urbana,+IL+61801/][805 West Pennsylvania Avenue]]. 

- The building is about 1.3 miles from Altgeld Hall. It is near the
  Pennsylvania Avenue Residence Halls (PAR), and the Illini
  Grove. Some members of the Department of Mathematics have relocated
  to this building during the [[https://las.illinois.edu/giving/altgeldillini][Altgeld-Illini renovation]] project.

- You are welcome to come visit me in my office. You should first send
  me an [[mailto:jpascale@illinois.edu][email]] to set up a meeting, for several reasons: the building
  is usually locked, and because my work takes me to different locations
  on campus, I may not be in the office when you arrive unless I know
  to expect you.

- When you arrive for our meeting, you should contact me to come
  downstairs to let you in. You can call *(not text)* my work
  number (217) 244-7277.
